# Rammanujan Project
My goal with this repository is to save in the cloud and let anyone my work on self study math. I choose the name because of the self taught mathematician Rammanujan who was an inspiration for me. I hope anyone that see this work could find it useful, motivational or interesting. Even when the main attraction of the repository is just math, you will find another peculiar content like coding files, recommendations and german documents for learning.

# Motivation
Mathematics is my great passion in life. Altough the official education is a good option, today in the 21th century we live in a world where we can get the knowledge for free and in any part of the world. That is what I want to use in my own benefit, in this case, for studying mathematics with online resources and then putting all my thoughs in this.
