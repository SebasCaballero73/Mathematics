# 30 Days of Machine Learning

# Motivation

What is a good adventure with no challenges? And since machine learning can be a challenging and exciting adventure, it is time for a good time working hard. The next is a list of goals for the next 30 days of machine learning topics, and the main objectives are:

- Understand the goals and focus of the machine learning
- Understand theoretically the basic models and algorithms of machine learning
- Create your first machine-learning model
- Understand the necessary topics for the introduction on NLP and Machine Translation
- Write the introduction and structure for my article
