Today I have studied most on what are vector spaces and their properties. In theory I have read all the chapter 1 of my main book(The chapter 2 on the other book) but I will refain and improve my knowledge throught a few days more and then I will be satisfied and sure to continue in Linear Algebra Topics. Somethings I have learned:
- The direct sum of vector spaces is somehow a fabric for interesting functions that create structure
- Structure is the most important thing in algebra!
- Quotient vectors are more than just a copy for group cosets. They also create new interesting things in basis and functions creating an injective one over the vector space.
- Linear transformations are so important that they themselves create new vector spaces and they are the basis for the structure of vector spaces
- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are weird things but they seem interesting and with a lot of potential
Oh, also, I have agreed some old exercises I did but that were on the old repository so this will sum up a little bit, but I will try to do as many as I can.
