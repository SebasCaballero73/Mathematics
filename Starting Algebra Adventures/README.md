Today I have studied most on what are vector spaces and their properties. In theory I have read all the chapter 1 of my main book(The chapter 2 on the other book) but I will refain and improve my knowledge throught a few days more and then I will be satisfied and sure to continue in Linear Algebra Topics. Somethings I have learned:
- The direct sum of vector spaces is somehow a fabric for interesting functions that create structure
- Structure is the most important thing in algebra!
- Quotient vectors are more than just a copy for group cosets. They also create new interesting things in basis and functions creating an injective one over the vector space.
- Linear transformations are so important that they themselves create new vector spaces and they are the basis for the structure of vector spaces
- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are weird things but they seem interesting and with a lot of potential
Oh, also, I have agreed some old exercises I did but that were on the old repository so this will sum up a little bit, but I will try to do as many as I can.

In this little day I have studied a little bit more on vector spaces, focusing on the dual spaces. I also wanted to learn about eigenvectors since they are so much related to Machine Learning an so I will try to do more exercises on these days before moving up. My next traveling could be the group theory domains, since they will be so needed indeed.

And I have started my adventure inside the german abstract algebra book. Now and differents concepts and explanations have apeard to me and I love to see this. I must admit that I am not understanding everything but I started to associate words like *menge*, *von* and I try to learn about the word function haha.
Also, new ideas have come to me. The main one is the next:
> Define the vector space of $n \times m$ matrices over a field $K$, denoted like $M_{n \times m}(K)$ as: $$M_{n\times m}(K) = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^n F^m$$ and so the new ideas over row operations and determinands could be seen as functions. For example, row functions would be linear transformations over the set and so their properties would be easier to prove and understand.
